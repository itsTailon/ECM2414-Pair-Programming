- Multi-threaded card game simulation:
  - All players play simultaneously (i.e. not sequentially).
  - If two or more players are given four cards with the same value — i.e. multiple winners — we do not need to account for it (we can just run everything again).

- Game setup:
- *n* players and a pack of *8n* cards.
- Hands drawn like in poken - round-robin fashion along table, up until 4 cards per player.
- Remaining cards in pack split equally to players, forming decks.
